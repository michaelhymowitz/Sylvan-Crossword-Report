# Sylvan Crossword Report

In these reports, I analyze my college friends' and my daily New York Times Mini Crossword scores. Each report provides tables and plots showing individual and group performance in the time period up to the date of report generation. Data has been collected everyday since December 8, 2021.

Report 2 is probably the best report in terms of inclusion of commentary, as while Reports 3-5 include much of the same data visualizations, these results have far less commentary, epecially per-person.

Note that in terms of code, much of what is contained in each `Report *` subfolder is largely the same, although minor code additions are made for each new report iteration due to evolving needs and ideas.

These reports are generated with RMarkdown, specically the `sylvan_crossword_report_*.Rmd` file in each `Report *` subfolder.
