# Sylvan Crossword Report

In these reports, I analyze my college friends and mine daily New York Times Mini Crossword scores. Each report provides tables and plots showing individual and group performance in the time period up to the date of report generation. Data has been collected everyday since December 8, 2021.

Report 2 is probably the best report in terms of inclusion of commentary, as while Report 3 includes the same data visualizations, these results are far less interpreted, epecially per-person.

These reports are generated with RMarkdown, specically the `sylvan_crossword_report_*.Rmd` file in each `Report *` subfolder.
