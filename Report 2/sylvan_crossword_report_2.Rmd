# 1) Introduction

![Woah! Friends!!](crystal_family_photo.jpeg)



Hey everyone, I'm back! The long-awaited Sylvan Crossword Report Edition 2 is here, and boy do I have more statistical analyses for y'all! I've written some new functions and have nearly 4 times as much data as before, so curl-up on your couch under a blanket with a warm cup of hot cocoa / cold Busch Light, and let's get ready for another 22 pages of graphs.

This installment covers from 12/8/21 - 2/14/21 (79 days), with the first report covering up to 12/28/21. We have a couple new participants joining us in this go-around, so please put your hands together to warmly welcome Addie (addieavery) and Meredith (meredithat), who join Anna (annabeans), Bahs (Bahsdaddy), Charlie (cnewt), Spank (crossword spank), Ellie (elliefich), Henry (grapefruit jones), Liam (liam), Mike Dale (mike dale), and Barnes (mikemikemike) to bring our total participant count up to a dizzying 11.

As with Edition 1, I have excluded my mom from these analyses, but I promised her I would include her stats briefly in this report. Had she been included, she would have dubbed up 48 times out of 79 days (60.8%). Nerd.

This report was predominately written over spring break in the back of crossword spank's car and in a haunted house in Nashville. So to answer your question, yes, this means I've spent my winter and spring breaks analyzing my friends' New York Times mini crossword scores. Single mike dale is thriving.

This report will be structured as follows:

1. Introduction
2. Methodology
3. Summary
4. Profiles
5. Declarations of Funding and Competing Interests
6. Acknowledgements
7. Appendix: Summary Stats and Graphs for Each Weekday

With all that being said, let's get it rolling!

# 2) Methodology

In writing this report, I basically used a very similar template as for Edition 1, updating the data and adding some more interesting ways of manipulating and examining the data to draw new insights.

For a discussion of the statistics utilized in these analyses, please refer to Edition 1. I heavily considered making the shift (baseball pun intended) from using z-scores to creating a metric analogous to [+/- stats in conventional sabermetric baseball analyses](https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/ops/), but z-scores have necessary mathematical properties, particularly with regards to averages, that +/- stats devastatingly do not. That was perhaps the lamest sentence I have ever written in my life good lord.

We do have a small problem with these analyses with regards to the addition of new people and daily rankings. Adding new participants has a couple of consequences, most obviously evidenced by the rankings of 10th or 11th not being available for the first month of data collection, or with being ranked 1st now statistically being more impressive than being ranked 1st before due to the increased number of competitors. I thought about different ways to deal with this, but they all involved degrading the interpretability of the analyses and plots, so I employed the close-my-eyes-and-cover-my-ears approach. If you have any moral quandaries with this decision, I'll have you know that on several occasions I literally would go to bed thinking about different solutions to this problem.

In a similar vein, we also have the massive soul-crushing issue of people completing the crossword less frequently than in the past. I don't really have much to say here except I like data, and in particular clean data, and so the presence of missing values makes me all kinds of sad. With that being said, I think it's weird to ask y'all to do the daily crossword for the sake of my disdain for slightly ugly data, but I wanted to bring this important matter to y'all's attention. Thanks!!

# 3) Summary

## 3.1) Overall Trends

```{r}
# Histogram and summary stats for overall distribution
overall_time_hist <- histogram_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                                        group_by_person = FALSE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE)

summary_stats_time <- crossword_scores$time %>%
    summary %>%
    enframe(name = "Stat", value = "Time (sec)") %>%
    mutate(`Time (sec)` = round(as.numeric(`Time (sec)`), 1))

grid.arrange(overall_time_hist, tableGrob(summary_stats_time, row = NULL, theme=tt),
             ncol = 2, widths = c(5, 2))
```

Good news! As a unit, crossword times are improving, with the median improving from 94.5 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["Median"]], 1)` seconds, the mean dropping from 142.0 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["Mean"]], 1)` seconds, and the lower and upper quartiles dipping from 60.2 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["1st Qu."]], 1)` seconds and 174.5 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["3rd Qu."]], 1)` seconds, respectively.

We also have a new record minimum score, with elliefich's previous record of 23 seconds being bested 11 times since 12/28/21. The new record is held by newcomer addieavery, who on 1/5 solved the Wednesday puzzle in just 11 seconds.

```{r message = FALSE}
# Scatterplot of overall times
scatterplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                     group_by_person = FALSE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                     add_mean_line = TRUE) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = as_date("2021-12-28"),
               linetype = "dotted")
```

```{r}
# Overall best week
best_weeks(crossword_scores, time_var = "time", group_by_person = FALSE) %>%
    select(-crossword_week) %>%
    kable_nice_names(caption = "Overall Best Week")
```

As a whole, average crossword times improved, continuing the trend shown in the first 3 weeks, although necessarily at a slower pace. We also have a new record overall best week, with the week of `r best_weeks(crossword_scores, time_var = "time", group_by_person = FALSE)$crossword_week[[1]] %>% as_date %>% format(format = "%m/%d")` having an average solve time of `r round(best_weeks(crossword_scores, time_var = "time", group_by_person = FALSE)$week_avg_time[[1]], 1)` seconds, surpassing the previous best of 113.5 seconds during the week of 12/19. Note that our average solve time of `r best_weeks(crossword_scores, time_var = "time", group_by_person = FALSE) %>% filter(time == min(time)) %>% .$time` seconds on `r best_weeks(crossword_scores, time_var = "time", group_by_person = FALSE) %>% filter(time == min(time)) %>% .$date %>% format(format = "%m/%d")` is tied for 7th for our best overall day, with our performance on `r crossword_scores %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(time = mean(time)) %>% arrange(time) %>% slice(1) %>% .$date %>% format(format = "%m/%d")` with an average solve time of `r crossword_scores %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(time = mean(time)) %>% arrange(time) %>% slice(1) %>% .$time` seconds taking top spot.

## 3.2) Individuals' Scores

```{r fig.height = 20,  fig.width = 28, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## Plots of individual distributions

# Boxplots
grouped_time_boxplot <- boxplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                                         group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE)
grouped_time_z_boxplot <- boxplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time_z",
                                           group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE)

# Histograms / Barplots
grouped_time_hist <- histogram_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                                        group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE)
grouped_time_z_hist <- histogram_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time_z",
                                          group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE)
grouped_rank_barplot <- barplot_for_rank(crossword_scores, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                                         add_bar_label = TRUE)

# Scatterplots
grouped_time_scatter <- scatterplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                                             group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                                             add_mean_line = TRUE)
grouped_time_z_scatter <- scatterplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time_z",
                                               group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                                               add_mean_line = TRUE)
grouped_rank_scatter <- scatterplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "rank",
                                             group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                                             add_mean_line = TRUE)

# Combining all 8 plots
(grouped_time_boxplot + grouped_time_z_boxplot) /
    (grouped_time_hist + grouped_time_scatter) /
    (grouped_time_z_hist + grouped_time_z_scatter) /
    (grouped_rank_barplot + grouped_rank_scatter)
```

One fresh storyline from these plots is the meteoric rise of liam in the past couple of months, who, after only winning twice in the first 21 days, has since won 26 times over the last 58 days to take the #1 spot from grapefruit jones in the power rankings. Although, liam, grapefruit jones, and Bahsdaddy's boxplots being so similar to one another shows there is space to close the gap at the top.

The good news is everyone's time seem to be trending downwards, so everyone can pat themselves on the back for that!

Note that in the above boxplots and histograms, the dotted lines represent the overall average, while in the scatterplots, the dashed lines represent each participant's personal average.

\newpage

```{r}
# Frequency count for each person in each rank
map_dfr(names_vec,
        function(name_in) {
            
            num_days <- crossword_scores %>%
                .$date %>%
                unique %>%
                length
            
            crossword_scores %>%
                filter(name == name_in) %>%
                .$rank %>%
                table %>% # frequency count
                as_tibble %>%
                rename(rank = ".") %>%
                mutate(total_rank_score = n * (length(names_vec) - as.integer(rank) + 1)) %>%
                bind_rows(
                    tibble(rank = "N/A",
                           n = num_days - sum(.$n),
                           total_rank_score = 0)
                ) %>%
                mutate(name = name_in,
                       total_score = sum(total_rank_score))
        }) %>%
    pivot_wider(id_cols = c(name, total_score), names_from = rank, values_from = n) %>%
    replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%
    arrange(desc(total_score)) %>%
    select(name, as.character(1:length(names_vec)), "N/A", total_score) %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 0, caption = "Rankings of Each Player")
```

The above table displays the number of times each player has finished at each rank, with the `Total Score` column being the sum of points if a 1st-place finish gets 11 points, 2nd-place gets 10, ..., 11th-place gets 1 point. The `N/A` column represents amount of times a person missed a crossword puzzle (starting on 12/08/21), so the biggest of thanks goes to annabeans, Bahsdaddy, and liam for not having missed a single day yet.

## 3.3) Improvements in Most Recent Period

```{r}
# Average time before and after a given date (date is inclusive in first range)
cutoff_date <- as_date("2021-12-28")
```

This section will explore performance before (inclusive) and after `r format(cutoff_date, format = "%m/%d/%y")`, which is the final date in which data was included for Edition 1.

```{r}
# Calculating scores before and after cutoff_date
cutoff_scores <- crossword_scores %>%
    mutate(pre_cutoff = ifelse(date <= cutoff_date, "pre_cutoff", "post_cutoff")) %>%
    group_by(name, pre_cutoff) %>%
    summarize(avg_time = mean(time),
              avg_time_z = mean(time_z),
              avg_rank = mean(rank),
              .groups = "drop") %>%
    pivot_wider(id_cols = name, names_from = pre_cutoff, values_from = starts_with("avg_")) %>%
    mutate(change_in_time = avg_time_post_cutoff - avg_time_pre_cutoff,
           change_in_time_z = avg_time_z_post_cutoff - avg_time_z_pre_cutoff,
           change_in_rank = avg_rank_post_cutoff - avg_rank_pre_cutoff) %>%
    select(name,
           avg_time_pre_cutoff, avg_time_post_cutoff, change_in_time,
           avg_time_z_pre_cutoff, avg_time_z_post_cutoff, change_in_time_z,
           avg_rank_pre_cutoff, avg_rank_post_cutoff, change_in_rank) %>%
    rename_with(~str_replace(.x, "_cutoff", str_c("-", format(cutoff_date, "%m/%d"))))
```

```{r}
# Change in times
cutoff_scores %>%
    select(name, starts_with("avg_time_p"), change_in_time) %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 1, caption = "Change in Average Time")
```


The biggest improvement in times goes to cnewt, with an average `r cutoff_scores %>% filter(name == "cnewt") %>% .$change_in_time %>% abs %>% round`-second improvement in this second period.

\newpage

```{r}
# Change in z-scores
cutoff_scores %>%
    select(name, starts_with("avg_time_z_p"), change_in_time_z) %>%
    rename_with(~str_replace(.x, "time_z", "z-score")) %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2, caption = "Change in Average Z-Score")
```

mike dale holds the biggest improvement in z-scores, with an average of a `r cutoff_scores %>% filter(name == "mike dale") %>% .$change_in_time_z %>% abs %>% round(2)` improvement per puzzle.

```{r}
# Change in rank
cutoff_scores %>%
    select(name, starts_with("avg_rank_p"), change_in_rank) %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 1, caption = "Change in Average Rank")
```

In terms of rank, Bahsdaddy showed the biggest average movement up the standings, with an average improvement per day of `r cutoff_scores %>% filter(name == "Bahsdaddy") %>% .$change_in_rank %>% abs %>% round(1)`.

Note that the `Change In Rank` column is somewhat misleading due to the previously discussed addition of new people, meaning people's ranks will on average naturally drift upwards. With that being said, if you have a negative `Change In Rank`, that is extra impressive!

# 4) Profiles

As with Edition 1, out of the goodness of my heart, I have made everyone their own page with their own statistics and graphs. I hope these inspire you to hit the lab and continue to improve your crossword times, if nothing else for the sake of impressing me.

Note that in all the plots in this section, the dotted and dashed lines represent the person's personal average.

## 4.1) addieavery

```{r fig.height = 12,  fig.width = 18, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
profile_plots("addieavery")
```

```{r}
profile_summary_stats("addieavery") %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2)
```

```{r}
profile_best_weeks("addieavery") %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2)
```

addieavery enters the competition as a formidable threat, on average falling well below the average time with a mean z-score of -0.39 and an average rank of 4.5.

Highlights include 3 first-place finishes and 16 top-3 finishes in just 46 solves, solving below the average solve time on 37 (80.4%) days, the t-4th longest streak for the most consecutive sub-minute solve times, accomplishing the feat in 4 straight days on two separate occasions (1/31-2/3 and 2/21-2/24), and the quickest solve with her 11-second solve on 1/5, on just her third day in the competition.

\newpage

## 4.2) annabeans

```{r fig.height = 12,  fig.width = 18, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
profile_plots("annabeans")
```

```{r}
profile_summary_stats("annabeans") %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2)
```

```{r}
profile_best_weeks("annabeans") %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2)
```

annabeans comes in with easily one of the coolest distributions of the bunch, with her ranks being strongly bimodal, peaking both at 3rd- and 7th-place, averaging out at 4.56th place.

Highlights include 5 1st-place and 32 top-3 finishes (4th-most for both), the most 3rd-place finishes with 15, the 6th-lowest z-score on a single puzzle with her 27-second solve on 12/26, the 10th-longest streak of consecutive solves below the average solve time, doing so on 9 straight days from 1/7-1/15, and the 4th-fastest time with her 16-second solve on 1/5.

\newpage

## 4.3) Bahsdaddy

```{r fig.height = 12,  fig.width = 18, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
profile_plots("Bahsdaddy")
```

```{r}

    kable_nice_names(digits = 2)
```

```{r}
profile_best_weeks("Bahsdaddy") %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2)
