# 1) Introduction

![Best night of our lives](sophomore_party_family_photo.JPG)

Hi bestest friends in the whole entire world! I hope y'all are ready for the 4th iteration of the Sylvan Crossword Report!! This report has nearly 200 more puzzles documented than the 3rd report, as we have now surpassed a whole year's worth of puzzles. So, yeah, these graphs are going to be pretty damn cool if I do say so myself. I hope y'all are as excited as I am!!

This installment covers from 12/8/21 - 2/4/23 (423 puzzles), with the first report covering up to 12/28/21, the second report covering up to 2/14/22, and the third report covering up to 7/23/22.

As a data scientist, I feel it's important to be transparent about data collection methods, so there can be complete trust between all of us. So, I want to let everyone know that I skipped data collection for the puzzle for Thursday, December 8, 2022, as this day coincided with [1,100 New York Times Union employees striking](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/new-york-times-staffers-walk-out-after-contract-talks-fail-2022-12-08/). This is officially a pro-labor data analysis project, and as such we do not cross the picket line, neither in-person nor virtually. Stand for workers' rights everywhere, and join a union if you are able.

This report will be structured as follows:

1. Introduction
2. Methodology
3. Summary
4. Profiles
5. Declarations of Funding and Competing Interests
6. Acknowledgements
7. Appendix: Summary Stats and Graphs for Each Weekday

Without further adieu, graphs graphs graphs!!

# 2) Methodology

No methodological updates have been made since the first two reports, so go look there if you're really that interested. Or check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/michaelhymowitz/Sylvan-Crossword-Report) if you wanna see the super amazing sick code.

# 3) Summary

## 3.1) Overall Trends

```{r}
# Histogram and summary stats for overall distribution
overall_time_hist <- histogram_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                                        group_by_person = FALSE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE)

summary_stats_time <- crossword_scores$time %>%
    summary %>%
    enframe(name = "Stat", value = "Time (sec)") %>%
    mutate(`Time (sec)` = round(as.numeric(`Time (sec)`), 1))

grid.arrange(overall_time_hist, tableGrob(summary_stats_time, row = NULL, theme=tt),
             ncol = 2, widths = c(5, 2))
```

Our group's crossword times have continued to improve in this most recent interval, with the median improving from 65 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["Median"]], 1)` seconds, the mean dropping from 90.9 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["Mean"]], 1)` seconds, and the lower and upper quartiles dipping from 41 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["1st Qu."]], 1)` seconds and 112 to `r round(summary(crossword_scores$time)[["3rd Qu."]], 1)` seconds, respectively.

liam has once again bested his own record for quickest puzzle solve, surpassing his 7-second 4/24/22 solve with his 6-second 9/18/22 solve. liam now holds 8 of the 9 quickest solves, with Bahsdaddy holding the 4th-quickest solve with his 8-second solve on 1/22/23, although this was only a 4x4 puzzle.

```{r message = FALSE}
vlines_for_report_dates <- c("2021-12-28", "2022-02-14", "2022-07-23") %>%
    as_date() %>%
    map2(1:length(.), function(report_date, report_num) {
        list(
            geom_vline(xintercept = report_date, linetype = "dotted",
                       color = "forestgreen", linewidth = 1),
            annotate(geom = "label", x = report_date, y = 300,
                     size = 2,
                     label =
                         str_glue("Report {report_num}\n{format(report_date, '%m/%d/%y')}"),
                     color = "forestgreen")
        )
})

# Scatterplot of overall times
scatterplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                     group_by_person = FALSE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                     add_mean_line = TRUE) +
    vlines_for_report_dates
```

best_weeks(crossword_scores, time_var = "time", group_by_person = FALSE) %>%
    select(-crossword_week) %>%
    kable_nice_names(caption = "Overall Best Week")
```

Woohoo, slight improvements!!!!

                                               group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                                               add_mean_line = TRUE)
grouped_rank_scatter <- scatterplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "rank",
                                             group_by_person = TRUE, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                                             add_mean_line = TRUE)

# Combining all 8 plots
(grouped_time_boxplot + grouped_time_z_boxplot) /
    (grouped_time_hist + grouped_time_scatter) /
    (grouped_time_z_hist + grouped_time_z_scatter) /
    (grouped_rank_barplot + grouped_rank_scatter)
```

As mentioned in Report 3, when looking at the `Individual Crossword Daily Ranks by Date` plot in the bottom-right, most people's average rank is plummeting simply due to to the decreasing number of solvers per puzzle, hence why individuals' z-scores can plateau or even increase, while their ranks decrease.

Note that in the above boxplots and histograms, the dotted lines represent the overall average, while in the scatterplots, the dashed lines represent each participant's personal average.

\newpage

```{r}
# Frequency count for each person in each rank
create_total_scores_by_pos_table(crossword_scores, "rank") %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 0, caption = "Rankings of Each Player")
```

The above table displays the number of times each player has finished at each rank, with the `Total Score` column being the sum of points if a 1st-place finish gets 11 points, 2nd-place gets 11, ..., 11th-place gets 1 point.

I take no pleasure in reporting that I'm now at the top. That's literally only because I do the puzzles everyday.

\newpage

## 3.3) Individual Rankings by Number of Players Beaten per Puzzle

Clearly, there is a methodological issue if I am the front runner of this crossword competition, considering I'm objectively a thoroughly mediocre crossworder. The good news is this result can clearly be explained by the fact that not all 1st-placed finishes are equal. For example, if I win a puzzle by finishing 1st out of 3 participants, as I did on 6/9/22, in looking solely at raw ranks, that is identical to liam finishing 1st out of 11 participants, as he did on 3/12/22.

The following is a plot of each player's distribution of rank, faceted by how many total players solved a given puzzle.

```{r fig.height = 15, fig.width = 15}
# Frequency of each player hitting each rank, faceted by the number of total
# puzzle solvers
barplot_for_rank(crossword_scores, facet_by_weekday = FALSE,
                 facet_by_num_solvers = TRUE, add_bar_label = TRUE)
```

Now, we see a distribution of scores that is much more aligned with intuition, with liam being a very skilled crossworder, as he wins puzzles often regardless of the size of the competitor pool, while I have a much more uniform distribution across all competitor pool sizes.

To attempt to account for this, I have created an alternative ranking system to give a different perspective on the leaderboard, by instead scoring players per puzzle based on how many fellow competitors they beat. Thus, my solve on 6/9/22 would be worth 3 points, as I beat 2 competitors, and liam's solve on 3/12/22 would be worth 11 points, as he beat 10 competitors. This alternative ranking system is designed to reward players who achieved higher ranks in puzzles in which there were more competitors, and hurts players like me who have racked up a boatload of high finishes, largely by virtue of diminishing puzzle participation over time.

The following tables displays the number of times each player beat a given number of fellow competitors, ranging from 10, indicating a player bested 10 other players, to 0, indicating a player bested no other players (i.e., finished last), with the `Total Score` column being the sum of points if beating 10 other players gets 11 points, beating 9 other players gets 10 points, ..., beating 0 other players gets 1 point.

```{r}
# Frequency count for each person in each number of competitors bested
create_total_scores_by_pos_table(crossword_scores, "num_people_beaten") %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 0, caption = "Number of Competitors Bested for Each Player")
```

Now, we see that according to this scoring method, liam is the clear front runner, with annabeans staying in 2nd, while I shift down to 3rd, and I am really only sitting that high purely due to not skipping any puzzles.

The rest of the report will continue with using raw ranks, as opposed to number of competitors beaten, due to ease of interpretability, and due to the fact that this scoring system is also imperfect. For example, if a person finishes 1st out of 3 one day, and then finishes 1st out of 8 the next day, their total number of competitors beaten will have dropped by 5, which seems awfully variable for a player who finished 1st in back-to-back days.

I just want to make it clear that I don't think I'm the best crossworder, or even the 3rd-best crossworder for that matter, among this fine group of competitors.

## 3.4) Improvements in Most Recent Period

```{r}
# Average time before and after a given date (date is inclusive in first range)
cutoff_date <- as_date("2022-07-23")
```

This section will explore performance before (inclusive) and after `r format(cutoff_date, format = "%m/%d/%y")`, which is the final date in which data was included for Edition 3.

```{r}
# Calculating scores before and after cutoff_date
cutoff_scores <- crossword_scores %>%
    mutate(pre_cutoff = ifelse(date <= cutoff_date, "pre_cutoff", "post_cutoff")) %>%
    group_by(name, pre_cutoff) %>%
    summarize(avg_time = mean(time),
              avg_time_z = mean(time_z),
              avg_rank = mean(rank),
              .groups = "drop") %>%
    pivot_wider(id_cols = name, names_from = pre_cutoff, values_from = starts_with("avg_")) %>%
    mutate(change_in_time = avg_time_post_cutoff - avg_time_pre_cutoff,
           change_in_time_z = avg_time_z_post_cutoff - avg_time_z_pre_cutoff,
           change_in_rank = avg_rank_post_cutoff - avg_rank_pre_cutoff) %>%
    select(name,
           avg_time_pre_cutoff, avg_time_post_cutoff, change_in_time,
           avg_time_z_pre_cutoff, avg_time_z_post_cutoff, change_in_time_z,
           avg_rank_pre_cutoff, avg_rank_post_cutoff, change_in_rank) %>%
    rename_with(~str_replace(.x, "_cutoff", str_c("-", format(cutoff_date, "%m/%d"))))
```

```{r}
# Change in times
cutoff_scores %>%
    select(name, starts_with("avg_time_p"), change_in_time) %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 1, caption = "Change in Average Time")
```


The biggest improvement in times once again goes to crossword spank, with an average `r cutoff_scores %>% filter(name == "crossword spank") %>% .$change_in_time %>% abs %>% round`-second improvement in this 4th period.

\newpage

```{r}
# Change in z-scores
cutoff_scores %>%
    select(name, starts_with("avg_time_z_p"), change_in_time_z) %>%
    rename_with(~str_replace(.x, "time_z", "z-score")) %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2, caption = "Change in Average Z-Score")
```

mike dale holds the biggest improvement in z-scores, with an average of a `r cutoff_scores %>% filter(name == "mike dale") %>% .$change_in_time_z %>% abs %>% round(2)` improvement per puzzle.

```{r}
# Change in rank
cutoff_scores %>%
    select(name, starts_with("avg_rank_p"), change_in_rank) %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 1, caption = "Change in Average Rank")
```

In terms of rank, crossword spank showed the biggest average movement up the standings, with an average improvement per day of `r cutoff_scores %>% filter(name == "crossword spank") %>% .$change_in_rank %>% abs %>% round(1)`. What a braniac!!

# 7) Appendix: Summary Stats Tables and

## 7.1) Summary Stats and Graphs for Each Weekday

The following tables give each person's quartiles with respect to time, z-score, and daily rank. These are the same data presented individually in each person's subsection of the "Profiles" Section.

### 7.1.1) Summary Stats for Time

```{r}
# Summary stats for each person's times
summary_stats(crossword_scores, "time") %>%
    rename_quantiles %>%
    kable_nice_names
```

### 7.1.2) Summary Stats for Z-Score

```{r}
# Summary stats for each person's z-scores
summary_stats(crossword_scores, "time_z") %>%
    rename_quantiles %>%
    kable_nice_names(digits = 2)
```

\newpage

### 7.1.3) Summary Stats for Rank

```{r}
# Summary stats for each person's ranks
summary_stats(crossword_scores, "rank") %>%
    rename_quantiles %>%
    kable_nice_names
```

## 7.2) Graphs for Each Weekday

### 7.2.1) Distribution of Overall Times per Weekday

```{r fig.height = 9,  fig.width = 11}
# Histogram and boxplot of group's times for each weekday
hist_for_time <-
    histogram_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                       group_by_person = FALSE, facet_by_weekday = TRUE) +
    labs(title = NULL)

box_for_time <-
    boxplot_for_time(crossword_scores, time_var = "time",
                     group_by_person = FALSE, facet_by_weekday = TRUE) +
    labs(title = NULL)

hist_for_time +
    box_for_time &
    plot_annotation(title = str_c("Overall Crossword Times, Grouped by Weekday",
                                  sep = "\n")) &
    theme_fivethirtyeight_mod()
```

### 7.2.2) Distribution of Individual Ranks per Weekday

```{r fig.height = 9,  fig.width = 14, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Barplots for each person's daily rank for each weekday
barplot_for_rank(crossword_scores, facet_by_weekday = TRUE,
                 facet_by_num_solvers = FALSE, add_bar_label = TRUE)
```
